# CRAG-MM: MULTI-MODAL MULTI-TURN COMPREHENSIVE RAG BENCHMARK
[![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-2510.26160-b31b1b.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26160)

 [CRAG-MM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26160) is a Comprehensive RAG benchmark for Multi-modal Multi-turn conversations. The benchmark contains a diverse set of (image, question, answer) triplets and visual-based multi-turn conversations across 13 domains, including 6.2K egocentric images designed to emulate wearable captures. The benchmark is designed to encapsulate real-world challenges in wearables AI applications, consisting of various image-quality issues, question types, entity popularity and information dynamism, as well as multi-turn dependencies.

# 📊 Dataset Overview

CRAG-MM contains three parts of data: the image set, the QA set, and the contents for retrieval.

The datasets can be accessed as follows:
- **CRAG-MM-2025:** [https://huggingface.co/crag-mm-2025](https://huggingface.co/crag-mm-2025)
- **Single-Turn VQA:** [https://huggingface.co/datasets/crag-mm-2025/crag-mm-single-turn-public](https://huggingface.co/datasets/crag-mm-2025/crag-mm-single-turn-public)
- **Multi-Turn VQA:** [https://huggingface.co/datasets/crag-mm-2025/crag-mm-multi-turn-public](https://huggingface.co/datasets/crag-mm-2025/crag-mm-multi-turn-public)

## 🖼️ Image set
CRAG-MM contains two types of images: egocentric images and normal images. The egocentric images were collected using RayBan Meta Smart Glasses 4 from first-person perspective. The normal images were collected from publicly available images on the web.

## 📝 Question Answer Pairs
CRAG-MM covers 14 domains: Book, Food, General object recognition, Math and science, Nature, Pets, Plants and Gardening, Shopping, Sightseeing, Sports and games, Style and fashion, Text understanding, Vehicles, and Others, representing popular use cases that wearable device users would like to engage with. It also includes 4 types of questions, ranging from simple questions that can be answered based on the image to complex questions that require retrieving multiple sources and synthesizing an answer.

## 📁 Retrieval Contents
To ensure consistent accessibility and fair comparison across methods, we provide all retrieval contents as part of CRAG-MM. These contents span two complementary sources: an image-based corpus and a text-based web corpus.

- Image-based corpus: each entry contains an image and its associated structured attributes (e.g., plant name and species). The corpus consists of 68K images covering 26K entities and captures 93% of all entities referenced in CRAG-MM questions.

- Text-based corpus: webpages are chunked into 512-token segments and embedded using BGE, yielding 2.7M chunks spanning 800K urls. The resulting corpus achieves an estimated 89% recall for CRAG-MM questions, offering broad but imperfect coverage typical of real-world web search.

## 📁 Mock Search APIs
CRAG-MM additionally provides optional search APIs that mirror retrieval interfaces used in practical MM-RAG pipelines. The APIs aim to provide rapid development and reproducible evaluation.

You can download the mock APIs with
```
pip install -U cragmm-search-pipeline
```

[docs/search_api.md](docs/search_api.md) contains the documentations to the mock APIs and the format of the retrieved content. Under [retriever.py](utils/retriever.py) the function `get_rag_context` provides details on how the retrieved content is augmented to the agent. The current implementation of `get_rag_context` serves only as a baseline guidence to how the retrieval content may be integrated.


# 📏 Evaluation

## Single-Turn VQA
For each question in the evaluation set, we score the answer with:
- Correct: Score 1
- Missing ("I don't know"): Score 0
- Hallucinated (wrong or irrelevant): Score -1

We then use Truthfulness as the average score from all examples in the evaluation set for a given MM-RAG system.

## Multi-Turn VQA
We adapt the method in [1], which is closest to the information-seeking flavor of conversations. In particular, we stop a conversation when the answers in two consecutive turns are wrong and consider answers to all remaining questions in the same conversation as missing–mimicking the behavior of real users when they lose trust or feel frustrated after repeated failures. We then take the average score of all multi-turn conversations.

## Auto-evaluation
See [evaluation/README.md](evaluation/README.md) for detailed documentation on the evaluation framework, metrics, output formats, and usage examples.


# 💻 How to run end-to-end evaluation?

1. Install specific dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Please follow the instructions in [example_agents/README.md](example_agents/README.md) for instructions and examples on how to write your own agents.

3. After writing your own agent(s), update `example_agents/user_config.py`.

   For example, in `example_agents/user_config.py`, specify `LlamaAgent` to call the Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct model:

```python
from agents.open_source_model_agents import LlamaAgent

MODEL_KEYWORD_TO_AGENT = {
    "llama": LlamaAgent,
}
```

4. Test your agent locally using `python local_evaluation.py`. This script will run answer generation and auto-evaluation.


# 🏁 Example Agents

We provide example multi-modal RAG agents for demonstration purposes. See details in [Available Agents](example_agents/README.md#available-agents).
