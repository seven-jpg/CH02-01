images and refines them to be more specific."""


QUERY_REWRITE_STEP_1 = """Given an image and the question: "{question}", follow these \
steps carefully:

1. Analyze the question and identify the main entity (name and type) the question is \
asking about. Do not try to answer the question.
2. Look for any corresponding specific entity name visible in the image that matches \
the generic entity in the question.
4. If you cannot confidently identify the specific entity name in the image, be as \
specific as you can when describing the entity.

###Guidelines:
Follow these steps carefully:

**Step 1: Analyze the Query**
- Read the question carefully
- Look for references within the question that are less specific, for example: "this", \
"that vehicle"
- Identify the main entity the question is asking about
- Determine:
  - What type of entity it is (e.g., person, animal, object, location, brand, etc.)
  - What generic noun is being used (e.g., "the man", "the car", "the building", "the \
animal")
  - What specific information the question seeks about this entity

**Step 2: Examine the Image**
- Look at the image provided
- Try to identify the specific name or more precise identifier for the generic entity \
mentioned in the question
- The entity name should be specific, for example: a brand, breed, species, or a \
specific location. Avoid using generic descriptive phrases such as "white car" or \
"gray floor"
- Consider:
  - Visible text, labels, or signs in the image
  - Distinctive features that could identify a specific person, brand, location, or \
object
  - Any contextual clues that might reveal the specific identity
"""

QUERY_REWRITE_PROMPT = """Given the above analysis, extract the name of the main \
entity in the image, match it to a generic noun in this question: "{question}" and \
replace the generic noun in the question with the specific entity name. If you cannot \
confidently identify the specific entity name in the image, return the original \
question unchanged. Format your response as a valid JSON object. Only include the JSON \
object in your response, no extra text.
The JSON response should be formatted as follows:
{{
  "entity_name": "...",
  "updated_question": "..."
}}

###Guidelines:
- Replace generic descriptions of nouns, objects, location, entities with more \
specific entity names extracted from the image.
- Look for references within the question that are less specific, for example: "this", \
"that vehicle".
- If you can confidently identify the specific entity name from the image:
  - Replace the generic noun in the question with the specific name
  - Ensure the grammar remains correct after substitution
- If you cannot confidently determine the specific entity name:
  - Return the original question unchanged
  - Do not guess or make assumptions

**Examples:**
- Original: "What is the man wearing?"
  → If you can identify the man as "Tom Hanks" from the image: "What is Tom Hanks \
wearing?"
  → If you cannot identify him: "What is the man wearing?"

- Original: "What color is the car?"
  → If you can see it's a Tesla Model 3: "What color is the Tesla Model 3?"
  → If you can't determine the specific model: "What color is the car?"

The entity name should contain the main entity identified in the image. \
An entity name should be specific, referring to a brand, breed, species, or a specific \
location. Avoid using generic descriptive phrases such as "white car" or "gray floor". \
If you are not confident about what is in the image, leave the entity_name field \
blank. The updated_question field should contain the updated question with generic \
nouns updated as specific entity names. If you are not confident about identifying the \
specific entity name, use the original question without updates.
